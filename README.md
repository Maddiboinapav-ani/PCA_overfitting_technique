# PCA_overfitting_technique
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a popular dimensionality reduction technique used in data science and machine learning. 
It transforms a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional one while preserving as much of the variation (information) as possible.
PCA achieves this by finding new variables, called principal components, which are linear combinations of the original variables.
